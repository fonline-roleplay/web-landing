                    <p><strong>FOnline: The Long Journey</strong> is a Fаllоut 1/2 based online RPG, set in Fallout atmosphere, following the original parts canon and ideas.</p>

                    <p>The game focuses on roleplay and survival, replicating the absolute ruthlessness of the Wastelands and the anarchic post nuclear world.</p>

                    <p>Forget about being a "Chosen One" or some kind of superhuman being able to change the world around. Here you are nothing
                        and nobody with the price of broken penny for the head of yours.</p>

                    <p>Your character is fragile, your aim is to survive and thrive, your dream is to find your place in the unforgiving world.
                        The place you have to fight for and the biggest enemy won't be the mutated fauna or the desert, but the very people around you.</p>

                            <div class="features__description">Player choices define the landscape. GMs offer a plot but how to play it is up to you.
Request non-player faction help? Overthrow the mayor and declare war to NCR?
Ban the carrying of weapons and turn the city into a utopia?
It&#039;s all up to you, but don&#039;t forget: wasteland is harsh and every choice or inaction taken might fire back twice as hard.

                            <div class="features__description">The game is long-term session-based, each one takes place in a certain place of the post nuclear North American
continent. Unlike in classic orignal, there aint no global map, instead a set of numerous locations are tied up
side by side -- yet still you can visit most well known original universe cities but -- as part of GM-curated event.
Mapping team works hard to make the locations look good and to keep it up to onging story -- after all, anything at
the game map can be build and demolished -- the whole landscape might change due to actions of players.

                            <div class="features__description">Except for skins, items and objects of the original F1/2 games we&#039;ve acquired permission to use a huge load of game
assets from other FOnline projects and F1/2 modifications, as well as added a lot of own creations including items,
game world objects, sounds, music and much more.

                            <div class="features__description">Since it is nearly impossible to provide fluid simultaneous combat-and-peaceful activities experience on large
multiplayer maps, combat is realtime-based. However, we tweaked it as much as possible to be both fun for those
who seeks the thrill of fight and not too bothersome for peace-seekers. Yet, beware, once you die, the game is over.
And nothing kills better than self-confidence. The combat differs from the original game and other FOnline projects.

Buy and craft furniture, move it around your home, plant stuff, burn stuff and just listen to some old world music on
newly acquired jukebox while integrating walkie-talkie into your combat armor at grandpa workbench. May items like the
vote boxes, vending machines, light and power controls are interactive -- try to figure them all out on your own.

                            <div class="features__description">We have a broad crafting system incorporating both classic &quot;fixboy&quot; mechanics and new specialized furniture craft
systems like workbenches, tables for growing mushrooms, melting machines and moonshine stills. Pay players for bringing
up resources, pay fellow crafters for providing you specialized components and craft your food, armor, weapons, furniture,
ammo and consumables the way you want. Beside, since it is a roleplaying project, we highly adore you going further and
actually roleplaying the crafting process -- the more realistic the more chances you have GM issue you a result that&#039;s not
even in the craftlists. Though. With high reward comes the great risk and who knows what&#039;s going to happen in a case of failure.

if you can mine some rare materials or just old good iron ore for further melting. Or, in the end just stroll around the ruins to
find some God forgotten junk pile to try digging out something useful with your multitool.

you don&#039;t want to bother with hiring guards or hunt for &lt;del&gt;slaves&lt;/del&gt; to work on your plantations, just buy or make a fishing
rod and chill out on the nearest shore. Just beware, don&#039;t step into water and be ready to run if a mirelurk comes to visit.

                            <div class="features__description">If nether farming or fishing is your vocation, you can always resort to the old ways and go hunt some unlucky animal to feed on.
Though, beware, hunting is second to none business when it comes to dying miserably because of your own neglectance. Only junkies
hunt with the bare hands - use hunting nets, traps and throwers to outsmart your pray and cheat your own death.
