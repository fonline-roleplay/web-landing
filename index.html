<p><u>FOnline: The Long Journey</u> is a Fаllоut 1/2 based online RPG, set in Fallout atmosphere, following the original parts canon and ideas.</p>
<p>The game focuses on roleplay and survival, replicating the absolute ruthlessness of the Wastelands and the anarchic post nuclear world.</p>
<p>Forget about being a "Chosen One" or some kind of superhuman being able to change the world around. Here you are nothing and nobody with the price of broken penny for the head of yours.</p>
<p>Your character is fragile, your aim is to survive and thrive, your dream is to find your place in the unforgiving world.</p>
<p>The place you have to fight for and the biggest enemy won't be the mutated fauna or the desert, but the very people around you.</p>

Request non-player faction help? Overthrow the mayor and declare war to NCR?
Ban the carrying of weapons and turn the city into a utopia?
It's all up to you, but don't forget: wasteland is harsh and every choice or inaction taken might fire back twice as hard.

continent. Unlike in classic original, there ain't no global map, instead a set of numerous locations are tied up
side by side -- yet still you can visit most well known original universe cities but -- as part of GM-curated event.
Mapping team works hard to make the locations look good and to keep it up to ongoing story -- after all, anything at
the game map can be build and demolished -- the whole landscape might change due to actions of players.

multiplayer maps, combat is realtime-based. However, we tweaked it as much as possible to be both fun for those
who seeks the thrill of fight and not too bothersome for peace-seekers. Yet, beware, once you die, the game is over.
And nothing kills better than self-confidence. The combat differs from the original game and other FOnline projects.

systems like workbenches, tables for growing mushrooms, melting machines and moonshine stills. Pay players for bringing
up resources, pay fellow crafters for providing you specialized components and craft your food, armor, weapons, furniture,
ammo and consumables the way you want. Beside, since it is a roleplaying project, we highly adore you going further and
actually roleplaying the crafting process -- the more realistic the more chances you have GM issue you a result that's not
even in the craftlists. Though. With high reward comes the great risk and who knows what's going to happen in a case of failure.

hunt with the bare hands - use hunting nets, traps and throwers to outsmart your pray and cheat your own death.
