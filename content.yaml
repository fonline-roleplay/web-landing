        Player choices define the landscape. GMs offer a plot but how to play it is up to you.
        Request non-player faction help? Overthrow the mayor and declare war to NCR?
        Ban the carrying of weapons and turn the city into a utopia?
        It's all up to you, but don't forget: wasteland is harsh and every choice or inaction taken might fire back twice as hard.
    - title: Custom locations

      description: |
        The game is long-term session-based, each one takes place in a certain place of the post nuclear North American
        continent. Unlike in classic orignal, there aint no global map, instead a set of numerous locations are tied up
        side by side -- yet still you can visit most well known original universe cities but -- as part of GM-curated event.
        Mapping team works hard to make the locations look good and to keep it up to onging story -- after all, anything at
        the game map can be build and demolished -- the whole landscape might change due to actions of players.
    - title: Custom assets

        Except for skins, items and objects of the original F1/2 games we've acquired permission to use a huge load of game
        assets from other FOnline projects and F1/2 modifications, as well as added a lot of own creations including items,
        game world objects, sounds, music and much more.
    - title: Realtime combat & permadeath

      description: |
        Since it is nearly impossible to provide fluid simultaneous combat-and-peaceful activities experience on large
        multiplayer maps, combat is realtime-based. However, we tweaked it as much as possible to be both fun for those
        who seeks the thrill of fight and not too bothersome for peace-seekers. Yet, beware, once you die, the game is over.
        And nothing kills better than self-confidence. The combat differs from the original game and other FOnline projects.
    - title: Interactivity

        Aside ability to change the game world with our mapping team support, there are a lot of things you can do on yoruself.
        Buy and craft furniture, move it around your home, plant stuff, burn stuff and just listen to some old world music on
        newly acquired jukebox while integrating walkie-talkie into your combat armor at grandpa workbench. May items like the
        vote boxes, vending machines, light and power controls are interactive -- try to figure them all out on your own.
    - title: Crafting
      icon: /assets/icons/plans.png
      image: img/17.png
      description: |
        We have a broad crafting system incorporating both classic "fixboy" mechanics and new specialized furniture craft
        systems like workbenches, tables for growing mushrooms, melting machines and moonshine stills. Pay players for bringing
        up resources, pay fellow crafters for providing you specialized components and craft your food, armor, weapons, furniture,
        ammo and consumables the way you want. Beside, since it is a roleplaying project, we highly adore you going further and
        actually roleplaying the crafting process -- the more realistic the more chances you have GM issue you a result that's not
        even in the craftlists. Though. With high reward comes the great risk and who knows what's going to happen in a case of failure.
    - title: Logging, mining, scavenging
      icon: /assets/icons/pickaxe.png
      description: |
        Most game world trees can be chopped for wood. Given you have the necessary equipment you can visit the local cave system to see
        if you can mine some rare materials or just old good iron ore for further melting. Or, in the end just stroll around the ruins to
        find some God forgotten junk pile to try digging out something useful with your multitool.
    - title: Farming and fishing
      icon: /assets/icons/radcvet.png
      description: |
        Given you have fertile land and the seeds, you might try to become a succesfull farmer and grow up you food and fortune. Or, if
        you don't want to bother with hiring guards or hunt for <del>slaves</del> to work on your plantations, just buy or make a fishing
        rod and chill out on the nearest shore. Just beware, don't step into water and be ready to run if a mirelurk comes to visit.
    - title: Hunting and skinning
      icon: /assets/icons/capcan.png
      image: img/12.png
      description: |
        If nether farming or fishing is your vocation, you can always resort to the old ways and go hunt some unlucky animal to feed on.
        Though, beware, hunting is second to none business when it comes to dying miserably because of your own neglectance. Only junkies
        hunt with the bare hands - use hunting nets, traps and throwers to outsmart your pray and cheat your own death.
    - title: Hunger, thirst and more
      icon: /assets/icons/meat.png
      description: |
        Whether you are a passing savage or mayor of the city, you are still a mere human. We have non-obtrusive hunger and thirst mechanics
        to ensure your character is not feeding on a thin air. You can get drunk, irradiated or forever injured, run into some serious
        really incident and GMs will make it sure to make you remember it for long.
